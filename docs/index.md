# SkyTrack Documentation

SkyTrack is a small helper library wrapping Weights & Biases (W&B) calls
and bundling out‑of‑the‑box support for SkyPilot job launches.

## Features

* Zero‑boilerplate `st.init(cfg)` to initialise W&B
* Opinionated dashboard so every run looks the same
* Lightweight helpers for gradients, LR, system metrics
* Artifacts helper to bundle configs, checkpoints, etc.
* HuggingFace TrainerCallback for free logging
